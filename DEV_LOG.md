## Active Tasks

### ðŸ“‹ IMAGE STANDARDIZATION TASK (For User)

**PRIORITY**: Medium - Required for future product additions and optimal web performance

#### Current Image Issues
- Mixed file formats (.jpeg/.jpg) causing display inconsistencies
- Inconsistent file naming conventions across product folders
- Non-optimized file sizes for web delivery
- Missing images for some product variants (C# Classic only has front views)

#### Required Image Specifications

**1. Product Grid Thumbnails** (ProductsGrid.tsx, FeaturedProducts.tsx)
- **Size**: 400x400px or 500x500px (square aspect ratio)
- **Format**: .webp (preferred) or .jpeg
- **Compression**: 70-80% quality
- **Usage**: Card previews in product listings

**2. Product Detail Carousel** (ImageCarousel.tsx on SingleProduct page)
- **Size**: 800x800px to 1200x1200px (square aspect ratio)  
- **Format**: .webp (preferred) or .jpeg
- **Compression**: 80-90% quality
- **Usage**: Main product showcase with zoom capability

**3. Hero/Featured Images** (Hero.tsx, About.tsx)
- **Size**: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: .webp (preferred) or .jpeg
- **Compression**: 80-90% quality
- **Usage**: Large promotional banners

#### Standardized File Naming Convention
```
{Language}-{Fit}-{View}-{Person}-{Color}.{ext}

Examples:
- Python-Classic-Front-Person1-Black.webp
- Java-Premium-Back-Person2-Black.webp
- Rust-Classic-Front-Product-Black.webp (for flat/product shots)
```

#### Folder Structure (Recommended)
```
/public/images/products/
â”œâ”€â”€ thumbnails/           # 400x400px grid images
â”œâ”€â”€ gallery/             # 800x1200px carousel images  
â”œâ”€â”€ hero/               # 1200x800px promotional images
â””â”€â”€ originals/          # Backup of source files
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Audit current images** - Document what exists vs what's needed
2. **Create web-optimized versions** using tools like ImageOptim, Squoosh, or similar
3. **Implement consistent naming** across all product images
4. **Update imageUtils.ts** to use new folder structure and naming
5. **Add missing images** for products that only have partial coverage
6. **Test loading performance** and adjust compression as needed

#### Tools for Image Processing
- **Online**: Squoosh.app (Google's web image optimizer)
- **CLI**: ImageMagick, Sharp, or cwebp
- **Batch**: Photoshop Actions, GIMP batch processing

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement unit tests for utility functions (imageUtils.ts)
- [ ] Add component testing for ImageCarousel and Footer
- [ ] Set up TypeScript strict mode checks in CI/CD
- [ ] Add build validation tests to catch compilation errors early
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing

### ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement language/fit filtering system
- [ ] Add product search functionality
- [ ] SEO optimization for developer keywords
- [ ] Performance optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Etsy API integration for real-time inventory
- [ ] Analytics integration
