## Development History

### 2025-09-13 - Premium UI Refresh, Blog, and Automation

Completed by: Luis + ChatGPT (Codex CLI)

Frontend polish
- Sticky, translucent navbar with subtle border and backdrop blur.
- Hero copy refined to authentic, humble tone (no hype; subtle humor).
- Product cards and featured cards: hover gradient overlays + inline ‚ÄúBuy on Etsy‚Äù CTAs; locale-aware currency formatting.
- Single product: added About, Key Features (icons), Care Instructions (icons), highlights chips, mobile sticky buy bar, and trust cues.
- Products listing now hides Classic fit items per request (Premium only).
- Product image paths corrected for Premium generic assets; global de-duplication of image URLs in `imageUtils.ts` to prevent duplicate renders.

Blog
- New blog with Medium-like cards and refined post layout; larger covers, tags, persona badges, prev/next.
- Added initial posts: history + beginner lessons for Python, TypeScript, PHP; history for Rust, Java, C#.
- References section rendered at post bottom (requires credible sources; official docs preferred).
- Persona system with subtle human names and voices: Monty Python (Python), Typey Tim (TypeScript), Hypertext Harry (PHP), Ferris Rustman (Rust), Java the Hut (Java), Dotnet Dave (C#). Added avatar initials and a subtle persona blurb box on posts.
- Neutral abstract SVG covers (no product photos) with 3 variants per theme/persona; deterministic selection by slug + soft persona/theme gradient overlays.

Newsletter
- Inline newsletter form on blog pages using Formspree; auto-hidden when not configured. Default wired to `/f/myzdvnow` so it works now.

Routing/Deploy
- SPA refresh fix for GitHub Pages: deploy workflow copies `index.html` to `404.html` so deep links and refreshes work.
- GitHub Pages deploy workflow added (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

Content & Copy
- About page ‚ÄúOur Story‚Äù rewritten to match Etsy-style authenticity (small batches, trusted printing, quick ship, make it right).
- Removed ‚ÄúQuality over quantity‚Äù from blog header per request; kept clean, honest tagline.
- Removed ‚Äúwink‚Äù wording site-wide; kept ‚Äúsubtle humor‚Äù.

Automation
- Weekend blog generator via OpenRouter with syllabus + per-persona memory for continuity (`scripts/generate-post.js`).
- Enforces 5‚Äëminute reads (~800‚Äì1100 words), structure (2‚Äì3 H2s, one code block), and at least one credible reference per persona (allowlist of official doc domains). Fails if not met.
- Default model: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`. Model can be overridden with repo variable `OPENROUTER_MODEL`; per‚Äëpersona `model`/`temperature` supported in `content/personas.json`.
- Runs Sat/Sun 12:00 UTC and opens a PR for review (`.github/workflows/generate-posts.yml`).

Tech notes
- New helpers: `src/blog/covers.ts` (variant selection + overlays), `src/utils/format.ts` (currency formatting).
- Navigation includes Blog; SPA routes added for `/blog` and `/blog/:slug`.


### 2025-08-09 - Image Standardization & Hero Carousel

**Completed by**: Luis + Gemini CLI + Claude Code

**Image Asset Refactoring**:

- Moved all images to the new directory structure with a standardized naming convention.
- Removed the old, unorganized mockups directory.
- Created dedicated `/images/hero-carousel/` directory with optimized images for homepage carousel.

**Code Refactoring**:
