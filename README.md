# SyntaxThreadsCo

SyntaxThreadsCo is a minimalist TypeScript + React frontend for the SyntaxThreadsCo Etsy store. It displays the full product catalog—developer-themed “Warrior” shirts across five languages and two fit styles—and links directly to Etsy listings for purchase. The site’s purpose is to establish a credible, brand-consuming presence beyond Etsy.

## Features

- Responsive product grid with filtering by **language** and **fit**
- Automatically populated from a `products.json` file reflecting Etsy inventory
- Lightweight and unopinionated: no cart
- Clear “Buy on Etsy” buttons opening listing pages in a new tab
- Clean brand styling inspired by developer culture and code identities

## Usage

- Serve locally using `npm install && npm run start`
- Build for production with `npm run build`
- Customize product metadata by editing `products.json`
- Substitute image assets or host them with a CDN

## Visual Style

- Neutral white/light-gray theme for trust and simplicity
- Monospace or clean sans fonts echoing coding environments
- Subtle hover / focus effects and generous whitespace
- Imagery emphasizes t-shirts in clean, well-lit flat-lays or mockups

## Why This Repo Exists

- To enhance authenticity and SEO presence beyond Etsy
- To reassure prospective buyers with a branded, web-native storefront
- To serve as a foundation for future site expansion or UI enhancements
