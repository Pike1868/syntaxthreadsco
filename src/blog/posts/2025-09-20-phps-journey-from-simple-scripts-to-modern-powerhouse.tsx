    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "<p>Hey there, web builders! Hypertext Harry here. Before we dive into modern PHP features in future lessons, let's take a quick journey through PHP's evolution. Understanding where PHP came from helps us appreciate the powerful tools we have today.</p>\n\n<h2>Humble Beginnings: Personal Home Page</h2>\n\n<p>Back in 1994, Rasmus Lerdorf wasn't trying to create a programming language. He just wanted to track visits to his online resume. His \"Personal Home Page Tools\" were simple Perl scripts that grew into something much bigger when he released PHP/FI (Form Interpreter) in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>Early PHP was... let's say interesting. Variable names required the dollar sign (still true today), but the language was inconsistent and lacked proper error handling. Still, it solved real problems for web developers, and that's why it caught on.</p>\n\n<h2>Growing Up: PHP 4 and 5</h2>\n\n<p>PHP 4 (2000) brought the Zend Engine, making PHP significantly faster. But PHP 5 (2004) was when things got serious. We got:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proper object-oriented programming support</li>\n<li>PDO for safer database connections</li>\n<li>Better XML handling</li>\n<li>Try-catch exception handling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This maturity led to frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, which still drive modern PHP development.</p>\n\n<h2>Modern PHP: 7.x and 8.x</h2>\n\n<p>PHP 7 (2015) was a game-changer. The performance improvements were massive - up to 2x faster than PHP 5.6. But more importantly, we got type declarations, return type hints, and null coalescing operators.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick example showing how modern PHP looks compared to the old days:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Modern PHP 8.x style\nclass UserProfile {\n    public function __construct(\n        private string $name,\n        private ?int $age = null\n    ) {}\n\n    public function getDisplayName(): string {\n        return $this->name . ($this->age ? \", {$this->age}\" : '');\n    }\n}\n\n$profile = new UserProfile('Harry');\necho $profile->getDisplayName(); // Outputs: Harry</code></pre>\n\n<p>PHP 8.x took things even further with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Constructor property promotion (shown above)</li>\n<li>Named arguments</li>\n<li>Match expressions</li>\n<li>JIT compilation</li>\n<li>Union types</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These aren't just fancy features - they make our code more reliable and easier to maintain. The static type system helps catch errors before they hit production, and the new syntax makes common patterns more concise.</p>\n\n<p>What impresses me most about PHP's evolution isn't just the technical improvements. It's how the language maintained backward compatibility while modernizing. You can still run (most) PHP 5 code on PHP 8, but you have access to powerful new tools when you need them.</p>\n\n<p>In our next lesson, we'll dive deeper into PHP 8's type system and see how it can make our code more robust. For now, remember: PHP might have started as a template language, but it's grown into a serious platform for building web applications.</p>" }}
